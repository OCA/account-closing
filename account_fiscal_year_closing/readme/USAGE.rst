For closing a fiscal year:

#. Go to *Accounting > Adviser > Fiscal year closings*
#. Click on create.
#. Select the year for which you want to perform the closing. If your fiscal
   year doesn't coincide with a natural year, input the last year of both of
   the involved years.
#. Select the closing template you want to use.
#. Click on "Calculate".
#. Check the result clicking on the "Show Moves" or "Show Move Lines" buttons.
#. If everything is OK, then click on "Confirm and post moves" for finishing
   the closing, posting and reconciling the journal entries.
#. You can cancel the closing in any moment pressing "Cancel" button, which
   unreconciles and removes closing journal entries.
#. If one of the created journal entries is unbalanced, as Odoo doesn't allow
   to create unbalanced entries, a new screen will be shown for checking the
   problem on the created entry.
