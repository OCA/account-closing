This module allows you to easily compute the prepaid revenue/expenses and also the revenue/expense accruals by using the **Start Date** and **End Date** fields of invoice lines/journal items.

For example, if you have an insurance contrat invoiced in April 2020 that run from April
1st 2020 to March 31st 2021, you will enter these dates as start and end dates
on the supplier invoice line. If your fiscal year ends on December 31st 2020,
3 months of expenses are part of the 2021 fiscal year and should not be part of
the 2020 fiscal year. So, thanks to this module, you will create a *Prepaid
Expense* on December 31st 2020 and Odoo will identify this expense with the
3 months that are after the cut-off date and propose to generate the
appropriate cut-off journal entry.

Another example: you have a UPS invoice dated January 5th 2021 that covers the shipments of December 2020. When you encode this vendor bill, set the start date as December 1st 2020 and the end date as December 31st 2020. Then, thanks to this module, you will create an *Expense Accrual* dated December 31st 2020 that will generate a cut-off journal entry that will "move" the UPS expense from 2021 to 2020.

Configuration
=============

Please refer to the **CONFIGURATION** section of the README of the module *account_cutoff_base*.

Usage
=====

To compute the prepaid revenue, go to the menu *Accounting > Cut-offs
> Prepaid Revenue* and click on the *Create* button. Enter the cut-off
date, check that the source journals contains all your sale journals
and click on the button *Re-Generate lines*: Odoo will scan all the
journal entries of the source journals and will get all the lines that
have an end date after the cut-off date and, for each line, it will
compute the prepaid revenue. If you agree with the result, click on the
button *Create Journal Entry*: Odoo will generate an account move at the
cut-off date to cut these prepaid revenue. Hint: you can then use the reversal
feature to generate the reverse journal entry on the next day.

If you need to answer a question such as *How much revenue did I already
invoice for my next fiscal year ?*, you will be interested by the
*forecast* feature. For that, on the Prepaid Revenue form, click on
the *Forecast* option and you will see 2 new fields: *Start Date* and
*End Date*. Enter the start date and the end date of your next fiscal
year and click on the button *Re-Generate lines*: you will see all the
revenue that you already have in your source journals for that period.
