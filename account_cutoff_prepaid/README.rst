This module allows you to easily compute the prepaid revenue and prepaid expenses and to generate the related cutoff journal items. It uses the **Start Date** and **End Date** fields of journal entries (copied from the same fields of invoice lines).

For
example, if you have an insurance contrat for your company that run from April
1st 2013 to March 31st 2014, you will enter these dates as start and end dates
on the supplier invoice line. If your fiscal year ends on December 31st 2013,
3 months of expenses are part of the 2014 fiscal year and should not be part of
the 2013 fiscal year. So, thanks to this module, you will create a *Prepaid
Expense* on December 31st 2013 and OpenERP will identify this expense with the
3 months that are after the cut-off date and propose to generate the
appropriate cut-off journal entry.

Configuration
=============

On the form view of the company, in the *Configuration* tab, there is a *Cut-offs* section where you can configure:

* the *Default Cut-off Journal*, which is the journal in which the cut-off journal items will be generated by default,
* the *Default Account for Prepaid Revenue*,
* the *Default Account for Prepaid Expense*.

Usage
=====

To compute the prepaid revenue, go to the menu *Accounting > Cut-offs
> Prepaid Revenue* and click on the *Create* button. Enter the cut-off
date, check that the source journals contains all your sale journals
and click on the button *Re-Generate lines*: Odoo will scan all the
journal entries of the source journals and will get all the lines that
have an end date after the cut-off date and, for each line, it will
compute the prepaid revenue. If you agree with the result, click on the
button *Create Journal Entry*: Odoo will generate an account move at the
cut-off date to cut these prepaid revenue. Hint: you can then use the reversal
feature to generate the reverse journal items on the next day.

If you need to answer a question such as *How much revenue did I already
invoice for my next fiscal year ?*, you will be interested by the
*forecast* feature. For that, on the Prepaid Revenue form, click on
the *Forecast* option and you will see 2 new fields: *Start Date* and
*End Date*. Enter the start date and the end date of your next fiscal
year and click on the button *Re-Generate lines*: you will see all the
revenue that you already have in your source journals for that period.
