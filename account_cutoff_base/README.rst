This module contains the technical basis for other cut-off modules ; it
doesn't provide useful features by itself. You need to install other
cut-off modules to get the useful features:

-  the module *account_cutoff_start_end_dates* will manage cut-offs
   based on start date and end date of invoice/move lines,
-  the module *account_cutoff_picking* will manage cut-offs based on the
   pickings.
-  the module *account_cutoff_accrual_subscription* will manage cut-offs
   based on subscriptions.

-  for each sale tax, configure the *Accrued Revenue Tax Account*,
