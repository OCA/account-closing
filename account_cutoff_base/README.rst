This module contains the technical basis for other cut-off
modules ; it doesn't provide useful features by itself. You
need to install other cut-off modules to get the useful features:

* the module *account_cutoff_start_end_dates* will manage cut-offs based on
  start date and end date of invoice/move lines,

* the module *account_cutoff_accrual_picking* will manage cut-offs based on
  the pickings.
