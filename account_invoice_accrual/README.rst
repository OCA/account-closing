Account Invoice Accrual
=======================

Many companies want to establish a complete accounting situation at the end of
each period. An important aspect of this process is to accrue invoices for
which the goods or services were received / delivered but for which the invoice
has not been received / sent.

Account Invoice Accrual lets you easily create these provisions entries.

Installation
============

There is nothing special to do to install this module.

Configuration
=============

The default accrual accounts can be configured on the company form.
Expense and revenue account can be mapped to other accounts when doing
accruals using the the mapping framework provided by the account_cutoff_base
modules (Accounting > Configuration > Accounts > Cut-off account mappings.

Usage
=====

This module adds a new Accrual button draft and pro-forma invoices. This button
triggers a wizard where the user can chose the accrual date, period, journal and account.
When later validating the invoice, the accrual move is automatically reversed 
in the same period as the invoice.
