Many companies want to establish a complete accounting situation at the end of
each period. An important aspect of this process is to accrue invoices for
which the goods or services were received / delivered but for which the invoice
has not been received / sent.

Account Invoice Accrual lets you easily create these provisions entries
from draft invoices. It adds an accrual button on draft and pro-forma invoices which
generates the accrual move. When the invoice is validated, the accrual move is 
automatically reversed.
